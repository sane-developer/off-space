# Story

Off-space is a company from the very future that developed a very specific material that has been proven to be critically useful in architecture; they named it "Verven." The material has iconic abilities and characteristics. It can easily be influenced to grow and shrink vertically and horizontally at will. Later, the company discovered that the material could also merge with other samples and be easily split up. Once the company's scientists mastered the art of using the material, they decided to put it to use and create an outpost that could change its shape and size at their command. While the outpost construction has been in the planning stage, the scientists determined that verven shows the strongest traits when it is formed into cuboid blocks. Therefore, they decided the outpost was going to be built with cuboid blocks made of verven. The scientists noticed that the blocks were quite sticky to each other, which led to more research. In the end, they managed to finalize the construction, and the result was magnificent. The blocks could interact with each other; they could change places, be entirely detached, and stick to different blocks. Verven could achieve much more than this. But for the sake of stable development, that is everything I was able to disclose.

# Agenda

The main agenda of this project is to put my software architecture design knowledge into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkHI1hGvWRY" target="_blank">work</a>. The main focus of mine is to implement a stable, reliable, blazingly fast, and finally easy-to-read and understand web API. Additionally, I would like to practice Docker, database design and writing SQL queries, and testing web APIs. One more additional challenge is to use CLI-only tools, disregarding the IDE (maybe someday).

P.S I came up with this story on my own to make the requirements on this project slightly more exciting. <br />
P.P.S Every design related decision on this journey will be discussed in DECISIONS.md.
