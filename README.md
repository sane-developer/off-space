# Story

There was once a group of mad but genius scientists in the very far future who led risky and dangerous experiments on a fragment of a meteorite they intercepted. The scientists have been instructed not to ever create any digital evidence of the project's existence, and that rule has been strictly enforced. The experiment turned out to be a huge success. After a few months of constant work on the meteorite fragment, the efforts eventually paid off. As a result, their scientists have discovered a new chemical element; it has been named "Verven". Unfortunately for the company, the monumental success came at an equivalent price. The entire scientific crew has been obliterated in a massive explosion, along with the entire physical documentation of the research progress. That is the story behind the creation of the most crucial piece of future architecture. A few years after the incident, a company named Off-Space released a paper about a newly discovered chemical element, which happened to be named "Verven". The paper contained a detailed description of Verven's characteristics and incredible abilities. With minimal influence, the element could replicate itself to some extent, be easily split up, and be merged with other samples of its kind. Additionally, the paper covered one significantly special case. When the material formed the shape of a cuboid, it started emanating a purple light, which incredibly amplified its strength and stickiness. The paper brought off-space a lot of contributors and investors, and above all, the company claimed that they were going to create something the world has yet to see. Shape-shifting buildings with unique interiors. One could say that the success of the company was already set in stone, but the ones higher in the world's hierarchy knew much better than that. They knew. They knew about the secret experiments conducted in the past. They knew about the potential catastrophe hiding behind the beautiful idea of the company. The restrictions were immediately put in place around the world, but not everywhere. That is the origin of the biggest advancement of mankind and the end of its very existence.

# Post scriptum

The story was made for a few reasons. Mainly, to keep me more entertained while maintaining this project. I figured out that my projects were simply shallow and contextless. Therefore, they ended up being ditched sooner or later. I assembled this story entirely on my own. Hope you like it!
