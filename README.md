# Story

Off-space is a company from very far future, which developed a very specific material, which has been proven to be critically useful in architecture - they named it "verven". The material has iconic abilities and characteristics. It can easily be influenced to grow and shrink vertically and horizontally at will. Later, the company discovered that the material can also merge with other samples and be easily split up. Once, the company's scientists mastered the art of using the material, the company decided to put it to use and create an outpost which can change its shape and size at their command. While the outpost construction has been in planning stage, the scientists determined that verven shows the strongest traits, when it is formed into cuboid blocks. Therefore, they decided the outpost is going to be built with cuboid blocks made of verven. The scientists noticed that the blocks are quite sticky to each other which was put into more research. In the end, they managed to finalize the construction and the result was magnificient. The blocks could interact with each other; they could change place, be entirely detached and sticked to different blocks. Verven could achieve much more than this. But for sake of stable development, that is everything I was able to disclose.

# Agenda

The main agenda of this project is to put my software architecture design knowledge in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkHI1hGvWRY" target="_blank">work</a>. The main focus of mine is to implement a stable, reliable, blazingly fast, and finally easy to read and understand web API. Additionally, I would like to practice using docker, designing databases and SQL queries, testing web apis. One more additional challenge is to use CLI only tools, disregarding the IDE (maybe someday).

P.S I came with this story on my own to make the requirements on this project slightly more exciting. <br />
P.P.S Every design related decision on this journey will be discussed in DECISIONS.md.
