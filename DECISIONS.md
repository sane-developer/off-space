# Product extension process

I am not really good at following "agreed minimum". I tend to sabotage myself with figuring out new features while creating certain functionality and it mostly ends in "context switch". This is something that caused me a failure in multiple recruiting processes. I will try to adress this problem of mine in this project by following incremental extensions of the product. Concretely, I will decide on the set of features that have to be implemented in targeted version of the product and implement nothing else (kinda more strict sprints?).
